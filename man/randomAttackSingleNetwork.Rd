}
\arguments{
\item{GRAPH}{a igraph object}

\item{p}{the fraction of remaining nodes}

\item{vids}{the selected initial attack nodes in the target and localized attack}

\item{attack}{the type of attack for random, target and localized and motif, the attack by id can be proceeded by the localized attack}

\item{mode}{whether to delete the outgoing incoming or both edges for selected nodes}

\item{decreasing}{sort degree from large to small or not}

\item{normalized}{the giant component size}

\item{returnGRAPH}{a logical, whether return the remaining graph or not}
}
\value{
a number of the giant component node
}
